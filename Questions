Answers to Questions
What other options could you use for server-side encryption?
Homomorphic Encryption: Enables computation on encrypted data without decrypting it.
Proxy Re-encryption: Allows a proxy to transform ciphertext from one key to another without accessing the plaintext.
What other improvements do you think would be interesting to add to the project?
Homomorphic Encryption Integration: Implement a version of the API that supports homomorphic encryption.
Proxy Re-encryption Implementation: Add support for proxy re-encryption for enhanced key management.
Multi-factor Authentication: Enhance security by implementing multi-factor authentication for user access.
Tokenization: Explore tokenization techniques to replace sensitive data with unique identifiers.
